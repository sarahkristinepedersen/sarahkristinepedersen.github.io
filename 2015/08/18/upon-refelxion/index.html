            <p>I haven’t kept a diary since I was a nine-year-old devoted Spice Girls fan/football geek (thanks Mel C for making those two things compatible). So why start now? Considering what is to come, it seems right; I need to be conscious and aware of my own development and remind myself about that. Just to be clear, I’m not going to take you through Makers Academy day for day describing every single step of the journey — that I’ll keep to my self and there exist plenty of other Makers blogs dedicated to this. So what is the purpose?</p>

<p>Makers Academy is at this stage all about unknown unknowns. However, what I do know is that I’m going to face some serious challenges on my 16 weeks long journey. I expect to be frustrated every single day about to give up and the only thing keeping me afloat is the expectation that I will be alright — that seems to be the precedence. If you don’t keep spirits high, you are most likely to drag yourself down and fail; keep telling yourself that you’re not good enough and you will end up with a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, that I’m not going to do.</p>

<p>During this journey, I want to follow my progress. Despite evident for your surroundings, progress might not always be evident to yourself. It is easy to feel stuck and lose motivation, but retrospectively, you notice how far you have come. I might not be able to entirely prevent feeling this way, but I am going to do the best I can to accommodate it by evaluating the course and my development day for day, week for week, month for month.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn’t have published my thoughts if it wasn’t for the fact that Makers encourage us to write a blog for both ours and their sake. And if I can assist in convincing some of you out there to break free from dragging patterns and revise your future — whether it will take you the coding way or somewhere else — it will be worth it.</p>
